# Introduction

JavaScript is a surprisingly powerful language.  
JavaScript is one of the world's most popular programming languages.  
JavaScript's popularity is due entirely to its role as the scripting language of the web.  
Virtually every personal computer has at least one JavaScript interpreter on it and in active use.  

#### The Name

The Java- prefix suggests that JavaScript is somehow related to Java,  
that it is a subset or less capable version of Java.  
But it is not true. JavaScript is not interpreted Java. Java is interpreted Java. 
It is a very nice dynamic object-oriented general-purpose programming language.  

The -Script suffix suggests that it is not a real programming language, 
that a scripting language is less than a programming language. 
But it is really a matter of specialization. 
Compared to C, JavaScript trades performance for expressive power and dynamism.

#### Bad books

Nearly all of the books about JavaScript are quite awful.  
They contain errors, poor examples, and promote bad practices.  
Important features of the language are often explained poorly, or left out entirely.

#### Amateurs

Most of the people writing in JavaScript are not programmers.  
They lack the training and discipline to write good programs.  
JavaScript has so much expressive power that they are able to do useful things in it, anyway.  
This has given JavaScript a reputation of being strictly for the amateurs,  
that it is not suitable for professional programming. 
This is simply not the case.

### Features

JavaScript is object-oriented.  
It has objects which can contain data and methods that act upon that data, and can contain other objects.  
It does not have classes, but it does have constructors which do what classes do,  
including acting as containers for class variables and methods. 
It does not have class-oriented inheritance, but it does have prototype-oriented inheritance.

The two main ways of building up object systems are by inheritance (is-a) and by aggregation (has-a).   JavaScript does both, but its dynamic nature allows it to excel at aggregation.

Some argue that JavaScript is not truly object oriented because it does not provide information hiding.  
That is, objects cannot have private variables and private methods: All members are public.
But it turns out that JavaScript objects can have private variables and private methods.  
Of course, few understand this because JavaScript is the world's most misunderstood programming language.  

Some argue that JavaScript is not truly object oriented because it does not provide inheritance.   
But it turns out that JavaScript supports not only classical inheritance, but other code reuse patterns as well.
