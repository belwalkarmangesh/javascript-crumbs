# Syntax

JavaScript syntax borrows heavily from C and other C-like languages such as Java and Perl.

## Case-sensitivity

In JavaScript, everything is case-sensitive:  
*variables*, *function names*, and *operators* are all case-sensitive.

## Identifiers

An *identifier* is the name of a variable, function, property, or argument.

Identifiers may be one or more characters in the following format:

* the first character must be a letter, an underscore `_`, or a dollar sign `$`
* all other characters may be letters, underscores, dollar signs, or numbers

```js
var name1;  // OK
var _name2; // OK
var $name3; // OK
var $;      // OK
var _;      // OK
var Name;   // OK
var 1name;  // SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
```

> #### tips
> Letters in an identifier may include extended ASCII or Unicode letter characters.
>
> ```js
> var Ã…mstrong; // OK
> ```
  
  
  
> #### convention
> JavaScript identifiers use camel case:
>
> * the first letter is lowercase
> * each additional word is offset by a capital letter
>
> ```js
> var firstSecond;
> var doSomethingImportant;
> ```

## Comments

JavaScript has both single-line and block comments.

#### single-line comment
begins with `//`:

```js
//single line comment
```

#### block comment
begins with `/*` and ends with `*/`:

    /*
     * This is a multi-line
     * Comment
     */

> #### convention
> for readability each line of block comment starts with `*`

## Statements

JavaScript statements are terminated by a semicolon `;`

```js
var sum = a + b   //valid even without a semicolon - not recommended
var diff = a - b; //valid - preferred
```
> #### tips
> Even though a semicolon is not required at the end of statements, it is recommended to always include one.
>
> Including semicolons helps prevent errors of omission, and improves performance in certain situations,  
> because parsers try to correct syntax errors by inserting semicolons where they appear to belong.

### Multiple statements
Multiple statements can be combined into a code block between curly braces `{` and `}`

```js
{
  test = false;
  alert('hello!');
}
```
